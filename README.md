# Terraria.Patcher
"Real World" Example on how to patch Terraria via dnpatch. It features Collectors Edition unlocking, Steam removal, a brand in the title and is able to patch updates even if bigger updates have been made.

## How to
Patcher: Just put Terraria.exe in the directory with the patcher and run the patcher. Copy the new Terraria.exe back to it's installdir.

Script (Doesnt unlock CE and doesnt brand!): Get the standalone from [dnpatch.script](https://github.com/ioncodes/dnpatch.script) and put the "patcher.json" in the folder. Run the patcher with Terraria.exe in the same location and voila :)
